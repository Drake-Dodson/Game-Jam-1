# Game-Jam-1
A game created with 4 other college students for a game jam as part of the ISU Game Development Club.
We had 48 hours to create a game from start to finish this was the result. The game is a rhythm game that 
gets harder and more complex the more consecutive notes you hit. 

You can check out a gameplay demonstration here: https://youtu.be/f8d4_zwhg2w
